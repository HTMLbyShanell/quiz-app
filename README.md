# quiz-app
This is a smaller ReactJS version of the Outer-Space quiz that I built using Java. In this application, a user can test their solar system knowledge by answering four multiple choice questions. You can watch me walk through the Java Console version of this application on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcWqmLt4xsA&t=46s .
